## PCIe

[PCIe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express) stands for "peripheral component interconnect express". It is the common motherboard interface for personal computers' graphics cards, hard disk drive host adapters, SSDs, Wi-Fi and Ethernet hardware connections. The most common PCIe standards are PCIe 3.0 and 4.0. 8-lane PCIe 3.0 has a bandwidth of 8.0GT/s while 8-lane PCIe 4.0 has achieved 16.0GT/s.

## InfiniBand

[InfiniBand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfiniBand) is normally termed as IB and is commonly seen in high-performance computing systems. InfinibandBand is a computer networking communication standard featured by very high throughput and very low latency. It can be used as interconnect within servers, among servers, between servers and storage systems and between storage systems. 4-links EDR and HDR IB can provide 100Gb/s and 200Gb/s for throughput.

## NVLink

[NVLink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVLink) is the GPU interconnect designed by NVIDIA. It is for near-range communication, which means between GPUs. It provides high-speed direct GPU-to-GPU interconnect 12 links for an Ampere-based A100 GPU can support up to 600 GB/s bandwidth.

## NVMe

[NVMe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVM_Express) is the short form for NVM Express. is an open, logical-device interface specification for accessing a computer's non-volatile storage media usually attached via PCI Express (PCIe) bus. It provides optimization for I/O-intensive applications.
